This project focuses on predicting whether it will rain tomorrow in Australia using a classification approach. The analysis begins with loading the weather dataset,
which includes features such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover. After initial exploration, the dataset is assessed for missing values, 
which are prevalent in columns like "Evaporation," "Sunshine," and "Cloud3pm." Appropriate techniques, such as imputing missing values or removing irrelevant data, 
are used to clean the dataset.
The goal is to use these cleaned features to build a predictive model for the target variable "RainTomorrow," which indicates whether it will rain the next day.
By understanding the correlations between variables and performing feature engineering, the dataset is prepared for machine learning algorithms.
The project likely proceeds with testing various classification models, such as decision trees, or random forests, to find the best-performing model.
Model evaluation would involve analyzing accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics to ensure reliable predictions.
In conclusion, the project combines data preprocessing and model building to predict rainfall effectively, with potential applications in weather forecasting and agricultural planning.
